# Join Us

I am always excited to hear from motivated students and postdocs who are interested in our research. If you are curious, collaborative, and enthusiastic about exploring new ideas, please get in touch!  

## Graduate Students
Prospective graduate students should apply through the *PhD in Statistics and Computer Science and mention our group in the application. I encourage you to reach out by email with a CV and a short description of your research interests so I am aware of your application.  

## Postdoctoral Researchers
I welcome inquiries from prospective postdocs with experience in **[relevant fields/techniques]**. Please email me with a CV, a brief statement of your research background and future goals, and contact information for references. Candidates are encouraged to explore independent fellowship opportunities (e.g., [insert examples relevant to your field]) and I am happy to support strong applicants.  

## Undergraduate / Master’s Students
There may be opportunities for undergraduate or Master’s research projects in the lab. If you are interested, send me a CV and a short note about your background, relevant coursework, and what excites you about research.  

## General Guidelines for Contact
- Please include a **CV** (with relevant coursework, research experience, and skills).  
- Write a **short paragraph** about why you are interested in our group and how your background fits.
