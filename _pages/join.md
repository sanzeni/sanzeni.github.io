If you are interested in joining the group, collaborating, or simply learning more about our research, get in touch. We welcome people from diverse backgrounds who are curious about how theory, modeling, and data can be combined to understand neural computation.
### Postdoctoral Researchers
There are currently no open postdoctoral positions. Researchers interested in developing independent fellowship applications (e.g., Marie Skłodowska-Curie, HFSP, EMBO, or national programs) are encouraged to reach out to discuss possible directions. 
### Graduate Students
PhD students join through the [PhD in Statistics and Computer Science](https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/phd/phd-statistics-and-computer-science) program. If you are considering applying, feel free to contact me for more information about the group or advice on preparing your application.
### Visiting Opportunities
Bocconi University offers several funding schemes that support short- and long-term visits by researchers at different career stages. If you are interested in visiting the group—either through a Bocconi program or with external funding—please get in touch to discuss possible projects and timing. 
### Undergraduate and Master’s Students
There are opportunities for research projects at the undergraduate or Master’s level. Projects can focus on theory, data analysis, or a combination of both, depending on your interests and background. If you are interested, reach out to discuss possible directions. When writing, include a few lines about your background, what you’d like to work on, and how it connects to the group’s research.
