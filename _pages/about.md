Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University. Before joining Bocconi in 2022, I carried out research at Columbia University, Duke University, and the National Institutes of Health, and was a visiting researcher at the University of Chicago, the University of California San Diego, and the Pasteur Institute in Paris. I studied theoretical physics at the University of Milan.  

## Research  
My research tackles fundamental questions in neuroscience by integrating theoretical approaches—mathematical modeling, statistical physics, and machine learning—with experimental data.  

Currently, I focus on understanding how the visual system supports complex functions. I approach this from multiple perspectives:  

- **Functional models**: How is visual information transformed along the cortical hierarchy? Do different areas gradually transform raw sensory input into higher-level abstract representations, or do they specialize in specific computations?  
- **Mechanistic models**: How do neural responses to visual stimuli emerge from the collective dynamics of neurons, from dendritic computations to multi-area interactions?  
- **Normative models**: Why are neural circuits structured as they are? Do particular features of brain networks provide computational advantages compared to artificial ones?  

If you are interested in joining, collaborating, or simply curious about this work, please feel free to get in touch.
