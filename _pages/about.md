I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University in Milan. My research aims to understand how neural circuits give rise to computation, perception, and behavior by combining ideas from statistical physics, machine learning, and the analysis of experimental data. Working closely with experimental collaborators, my group develops mathematical and computational models that link neural structure, dynamics, and function, with a focus on the visual system and on uncovering general principles of computation in biological networks. 

Before joining Bocconi, I worked in theoretical neuroscience, studying the dynamics of cortical circuits as a researcher at Columbia University, Duke University, the National Institutes of Health, and the University of Chicago. I obtained my PhD, Master’s, and Bachelor’s degrees in Physics from the University of Milan, with long-term research visits at UC San Diego and the Pasteur Institute in Paris, focusing on the theoretical physics of matter and biological systems.
